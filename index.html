            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Researches showed that study groups are often beneficial for students, and greatly contribute to
                    their academic successes. A collaborative environment helps people progress at a similar pace (i.e.
                    less procrastination), practice communication skills in preparation for the real-life work
                    environment, and finally, group members can learn by exchanging notes and viewpoints outside of the
                    class. The <cite><a
                            href="https://webster.uaa.washington.edu/asp/website/study-skills/tips-for-success-at-the-university-of-washington/">Tips
                            for Success at the UW</a></cite> page also listed the study group as an
                    important studying tool. Many professors and courses start to adopt the team model, most notably,
                    Informatics Program recognizes teamwork as an essential element.</p>
                <p>However, not every major encourages teamwork, and many courses don’t have a mandatory lab or quiz
                    section, which can help you find teammates to work with. There are other ways to establish a study
                    group, for example, announce your intention in front of the whole class or through the mailing list,
                    or put up fliers and discussion posts asking for teammates, which both require a significant amount
                    of organization and work. Furthermore, the people around you may not have a similar schedule, thus
                    forming a consistent and highly collaborative group to study with can be challenging. Therefore, an
                    accessible tool for organizing study groups is helpful. </p>
                <p>Are there existing solutions to this problem? <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/search?q=find+study+group">A quick google
                        search</a> will tell you there are two or three websites with similar ideas; however, they are
                    either not specific and personalized enough, or they can’t apply to all UW students. <a
                        href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> is first on the google list, after a
                    relatively easy registration process, you will find Meetup only ask you your location and interest fields 
                    when you try to create your group, turns out it’s more like an interest group catalog, which is
                    meant to attract a large number of people with board searchability and very little specificity. Next
                    on the list, <a href="https://www.studypal.co/">StudyPal.co</a> is established to be
                    a “find study group” tool, but sadly it’s only for people that want to obtain certain certifications
                    like GMAT, GRE, and TOEFL, etc., so it doesn’t suit every UW student’s needs. The last tool,
                    BuddyUp, is mentioned in a <cite><a
                            href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/buddyup-study-group-app/">blog post</a></cite>,
                    but sadly its link is dead, and presumably, the business fails.</p>

            <h3>Proposed Application</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The proposed application is a tool that facilitates the formation and search of study groups, in
                    particular, people can plot and share their preferred study location, communication methods, and group 
                    size through a web forum, and finally, utilize a competent search function that quickly points users to 
                    already existing groups.
                </p>
                <p>Although such a study group finder tool is useful and applicable to every college student, I would
                    like to confine the targeted user base strictly to UW students, especially I want to implement
                    features that streamline the group posting and finding process, limit unwanted user error, and adds 
                    a sense of security, because the users know all the study pals will be UW students. This also guarantees 
                    study pals are in close proximities, such as in the same campus or dorm buildings. </p>
                <p>Here is how I envision the process will be:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The user enters the website, and the website first prompts the user to search with course
                        numbers with visual cues, or they are free to explore all public available groups.</li>
                    <li>Then there is an advanced search tool to help the user further optimize front page recommendations, 
                        for example, study group objectives, preferred group size.</li>
                    <li>If there's a suitable result, the user can hover or click on a group (most likely a card) 
                        to inspect more info, including the group's self-description.</li>
                    <li>If the user chooses a particular group, the website will prompt the user to login and successfully 
                        authenticate, it will show the user that group's members' emails and preferred communication method.</li>
                    <li>If there's no suitable search result, the user will be prompted to sign-up and create a group. 
                        The user has to input a UW email address for future contacts.</li>
                    <li>The webpage then shows a forum to the user, the user will choose one of the courses he/she
                        has (or input manually), fill out optional information, like preferred communication methods, and 
                        group size.</li>
                    <li>After the user completed the forum, the user is automatically the group's admin, the webpage will send 
                        the user to his/her currently existing "Groups" page. </li>
                    <li>From there, the user can further manage his or her groups or create another new group. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This Web app hopes to fix the inaccessibility issues of finding a study group in UW, it targets the
                    UW students specifically. It helps students that are completing an online course, a big lecture with
                    zero labs, or users that are a little shy, to score a fantastic study group. Less coordination and
                    organization are needed to set up a meeting time and communication methods, so finding the right
                    group relies less on luck. The streamlined process of creating posts aims to reduce user
                    frustration: the authentication protects the user from trolls, prevents users from forgetting their
                    login information, and the need to handle another database; and the Student API helps users complete
                    forms faster and easier.
